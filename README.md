# None-Orthogonal-Multiple-Access
This repository showcases a project on Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). It includes simulations of NOMA systems, Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), and analysis of BER, SNR, and spectral efficiency. Explore error propagation, power allocation, and comparisons with traditional OMA systems. Ideal for wireless research.



This repository contains a project focused on **Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)**, a cutting-edge wireless communication technique designed to enhance spectral efficiency and enable simultaneous communication for multiple users. NOMA achieves this by exploiting power-domain multiplexing, where multiple users are assigned different power levels for their signals.

Project Overview
In this project, I have implemented and analyzed the performance of NOMA in various wireless communication scenarios, exploring key concepts such as:

- Power-domain multiplexing** for simultaneous user communication.
- Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)** for signal separation and decoding.
- Error propagation effects** in SIC and how to mitigate them.
- Performance evaluation** of NOMA in terms of **Bit Error Rate (BER)**, **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**, and system throughput.

Key Features
- Simulation of NOMA-based communication systems.
- Implementation of SIC for interference cancellation.
- Analysis of spectral efficiency and BER for NOMA users.
- Comparison with traditional **Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA)** systems.
- Error propagation study and strategies to minimize errors during signal decoding.

Tools and Technologies
- MATLAB or Python (depending on the implementation).
- Communication system simulation libraries and algorithms.
- Performance analysis and plotting tools.

Objectives
- To study the performance enhancement achieved by NOMA in wireless systems.
- To evaluate the trade-offs between power allocation, distance, and signal quality.
- To understand and minimize error propagation in NOMA systems using SIC.

Usage
Clone this repository to simulate and analyze NOMA systems in various configurations. Modify the parameters and observe the effects of power allocation and SIC on system performance.
