# None-Orthogonal-Multiple-Access
This repository showcases a project on Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). It includes simulations of NOMA systems, Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), and analysis of BER, SNR, and spectral efficiency. Explore error propagation, power allocation, and comparisons with traditional OMA systems. Ideal for wireless research.
